# Starknet Events

Project developed for ETH Global 2024 StarkHack hackathon:  
Starknet Events is a protocol deployed on Starknet and a dApp dedicated to foster participation to Starknet events using  
a "stake-to-register" mechanism.

## CONTRIBUTE TO THE PROJECT

### Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node (>= v18.17)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Scarb v2.5.4](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/)
- [Starknet Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/starknet-foundry) -> is it v0.23.0 or v0.25.0, though? their doc mentions both -_-'

### Quickstart

To get started, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repo and install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Band-of-Buidlers/Starknet-Events --recurse-submodules
cd Starknet-Events
yarn install
```

P.S: I'm not sure that `-- recurse-submodels` flag is needed...

2. Prepare your environment variables.

By default Scaffold-Stark 2 takes the first prefunded account from `starknet-devnet` as a deployer address, thus **you can skip this step!**. But if you want use the .env file anyway, you can fill the envs related to devnet with any other predeployed contract address and private key from starknet-devnet.

**Note:** In case you want to deploy on Sepolia, you need to fill the envs related to sepolia testnet with your own contract address and private key.

```bash
cp packages/snfoundry/.env.example packages/snfoundry/.env
```

3. Run a local network in the first terminal.

**Note:** You can skip this step if you want to use Sepolia Testnet.

```bash
yarn chain
```

This command starts a local Starknet network using Devnet. The network runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development. You can customize the network configuration in `scaffold.config.ts` for your nextjs app.

**Note:** If you are on sepolia or mainnet, for a better user experience on your app, you can get a dedicated RPC from [Infura dashboard](https://www.infura.io/). A default is provided [here](https://github.com/Quantum3-Labs/scaffold-stark-2/tree/main/packages/nextjs/.env.example), in order to use this, you have to run `cp packages/nextjs/.env.example packages/nextjs/.env.local`


4. On a second terminal, deploy the sample contract:

```
yarn deploy --network {NETWORK_NAME} // when NETWORK_NAME is not specified, it defaults to "devnet"
```

**Note:** To use sepolia tesnet, you have to set {NETWORK_NAME} to `sepolia`.

This command deploys a sample smart contract to the local network. The contract is located in `packages/snfoundry/contracts/src` and can be modified to suit your needs. The `yarn deploy` command uses the deploy script located in `packages/snfoundry/scripts-ts/deploy.ts` to deploy the contract to the network. You can also customize the deploy script.

5. On a third terminal, start your NextJS app:

```
yarn start
```

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contract using the `Debug Contracts` page. You can tweak the app config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.
